# CS-360


    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
    
    The purpose of this project was to design a mobile application for Android that had multiple screens for the UI, SMS notifications, a database for data storage, and a way for users to input user credentials/daily weights. The app was designed with a clear design language in place to ensure ease of navigation for any user as well as a wide range of functionality. the app itself was designed to be able to allows users to login into the app with their own credentials to be able to log their daily weights for weightloss tracking purposes.

    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    
    
    The app required mutliple scrrens for the UI. The first screen is a screen with two input fields and two buttons so a user is able to create/login to their account. The user is then taken to a dashboard where they navigate to different screens within the app and allows the user to input their target goal weight. The database screen allows for users to input their daily weight to be stored within the grid on screen which is then tied to a date. The final screen, notifications, allows a user to enable/disable SMS notifications once their goal weight is met. I believe my design was successful as it is extremely easy to naviagte and use while accomplishing everything that is required.
    
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    

    My main approach was to do as much as possible in one sitting. I know this sounds like a horrible way to design an applciation, but I tend to forget things and if I end the day with issues in the code, I may have forgotten what all I did the previous day that may have affected functionality. I would like to improve this in the future by breaking down the overall task into a bunch of smaller tasks witth a clear path established. This would help reduce my workload by having each task dedicated to a specific time where I can sut down and focus on that one peice of functionality. 
    
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
   
    
    As I added each feature, I tested it extensively within the emulator to ensure that any new features work and existing ones do not break. I also tend to test very frequently because if too much code is added at once, it may be difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. By testing extremely often, it left me with much less debugging at the end and I was able to focus on code clarity and extensive code commenting. I did my final testing on an actual device in the end, but I did not discover anything new that was not functioning differently versus the emulator. 

    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

    
    I didn't have to change much about my current habits. I just followed the rubric as close as possible to ensure that I had implemented all required functionality. I did have to do a lot more research than normal as Java is still not my strong suit and functions within the Android Studio are a little different than what I am used to but luckily i have used JetBrains a lot in the past and it wasn't too different. I'm also still not a massive fan of zybooks as I do much better with videos versus text like in zybooks.
    
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

    I believe I was most successful with my database implementation. I did a lot more research on that versus every other component and I am currently taking NoSQL database classes. That class has helped me in realizing how the actual database functions. I also excelled at code commenting on this project. I did much more commenting with this project as having every single piece clearly marked helped me pinpoint where issues lied if I did run into a problem and for future developemnt of the application.
